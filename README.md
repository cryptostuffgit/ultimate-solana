## About

The ultimate Solana front-end is a next js app that lets users pass in any program address with a published anchor idl, it then pulls the idl and gives the users forms any transaction along with getter functions for a specific or all accounts of a certain type. Next steps to create a naming standard to give the front-end the ability to derive pdas without the need for users to derive them first and then pass in manually.
